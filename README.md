# ETL + ML Mini Project

This project demonstrates a simple **ETL pipeline** with **machine learning** on user membership data. It extracts join dates, aggregates by month, and trains a model to predict trends.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1. **Extract & Transform**
   - Load user membership data (`DateJoined`).
   - Filter only 2017 records.
   - Aggregate members joined per month.

2. **Load & Train**
   - Prepare features and target.
   - Train a regression model.
   - Evaluate with **RMSE**.
   - Save trained model (`model.pkl`).
